Thank Dr. Cl√©ment W. Royer ( https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~croyer )                                  
for teaching me how to use CUTEst in MATLAB.

The package contains a set of tools to facilitate the usage of CUTEst
( https://github.com/ralna/CUTEst ) in MATLAB under Linux.
It provides the following MATLAB functions:

problem = macup(problem_name)  % make a CUTEst problem
decup(problem_name)  % destroy a CUTEst problem
problem_list = secup(requirements)  % select CUTEst problems according to requirements

For example, try

macup('AKIVA')

This should give you a structure containing the full information of problem AKIVA,
including its objective function, constraints (if any), starting point, etc.

Try "help matcutest", "help macup", "help decup", and "help secuo" in MATLAB for 
more information.
